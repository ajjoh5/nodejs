It was in these years that he noticed&nbsp;a common thread between all of them.</p><p>Businesses (in Australia especially) heavily <strong>under-invest</strong> in their tech innovation and entrepreneurial activities. </p><p>So much so that if they are not careful, they could find themselves out of business in the next 5 to 10 years because they haven't implemented a planned process of constant tech innovation.</p><p>On the positive side, if we invest in the tech innovation within our businesses we can separate ourselves from the herd and make our businesses unique, so much so that we can carve out our own space in the marketplace, because our customers can only get that innovation / service or product from us and no one else.</p><p>Adam goes on to state...</p><blockquote>\"Investing in tech innovation allows you to provide a unique experience to your customers when they do business with you.\"<br><br><footer>Adam Johnstone</footer></blockquote><p>By the above, Adam suggests that your business&nbsp;can put it's \"peg in the sand\", when it comes to making an example elevator pitch statement like&nbsp;\"We are Company A, and we have a new innovation that allows us to intelligently track what you like, so that we can give you more of what you want, and less of what you don't in a way that's integrated and not too creepy of course!\".</p><p>The above example pitch would be made possible through a process of planned tech innovation, whereby you invest, create, iterate and finally come up with that product or process that can deliver the above in a manageable and repeatable way.</p><p>It's time to commit to investing not only in tech innovation, but also in the future of your business, company or startup.</p><p><br></p><blockquote>\"You are either a player when it comes to tech innovation, <br>           or you are behind and playing catch up.\"<br><br><footer>Adam Johnstone</footer></blockquote><p>I tend to agree with the above, playing catch up is never fun!</p><h2>How do we Get Started?</h2><p>As <a class=\"text-link\" href=\"http://www.tailopez.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tai Lopez\">Tai Lopez</a>&nbsp;(TedX talks) states - \"Make war with a multitude of counsellors and allies\".</p><p>Adam brings to the table a deep expertise in apps, software, open source / licensed platforms and the latest in tech innovations collected from around the globe.</p><p>There's a multitude of innovators out there who play in this space, and your business needs to assemble the best team of allies you can afford.</p><p>Adam has made this process easier by shortlisting a \"who's who\" of disruptive people and technologies that he believes you should be following and potentially hiring right now.</p><p><a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://adamjohnstone.co/pages/contact-me\" rel=\"nofollow\">&gt; Talk to Adam now</a></p><h2>The Technology shortlist</h2><p>To stress the urgency, Adam wants to give you a shortlist of technologies you&nbsp;should already be using within your business, as a base for innovation and streamlining your processes.</p><p>If you're not using these below - then you need to (at a high level) understand how they work and why they are vitally important.</p><p>The shortlist is as follows:</p><ul><li><a class=\"text-link\" href=\"https://nodejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"NodeJS\"><strong>NodeJS</strong></a> - a server side javascripting framework, non-blocking - used in Silicon Valley extensively. It's strength is that you can create internal / external websites, apps and software quickly.</li><li><strong><a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ReactJS</a> /&nbsp;<a class=\"text-link\" href=\"https://angularjs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"AngularJS\">Angular 1.x &amp; 2 (beta)</a></strong> - Web UI frameworks developed by Facebook and Google alike.  You should be using these if customer experience is important to you.</li><li><strong><a class=\"text-link\" href=\"https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/sharepoint-2013-overview-collaboration-software-features\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Microsoft SharePoint\">Microsoft SharePoint</a></strong>&nbsp;/ <a href=\"https://products.office.com/en-au/business/office\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Office 365</a>&nbsp;/ <a href=\"http://drive.google.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google Drive</a> - Intranets, extranets, document management and workflows for enterprise / really intelligent cloud storage and collaboration spaces</li><li><strong><a class=\"text-link\" href=\"http://ionicframework.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ionic Framework\">Ionic&nbsp;Framework</a></strong> - Build your iPhone Apps / iPad Apps / Android Apps - using Angular as its UI framework (did we mention that it's built by Google??)</li><li><strong><a class=\"text-link\" href=\"www.asp.net/mvc\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"www.asp.net/mvc\">Microsoft ASP.NET, MVC, C#</a></strong> - server side code frameworks to build your enterprise applications on. Your code and IP can be compiled so that others have difficulty in copying or replicating your ideas and frameworks and it's maintained and developed by Microsoft.</li></ul><p>Adam uses, implements and is across the strategic advantages the above tech innovations provide, but they are only a snapshot of what you will need to know.</p><p>If your not across this list - then you need to get started now... nuff said!</p><h2>Adam's Background&nbsp;</h2><p>Adam&nbsp;started coding&nbsp;when he was 13 years old, after reading a series of Visual Basic 3.0 books cover-to-cover on a family holiday.</p><p>In high school he helped teach the Year 9 Programming Classes and continued programming studies at Monash University Caulfield where he learnt more about the industry.</p><p>Adam worked for notable large IT consultancies before niching down into specific technology platforms to get a better understanding of all of the available products and coding frameworks available to startups, small businesses and enterprises alike.</p><p>What he realised is that in most cases, key influential people in their organisations are making decisions with less than half the picture in front of them.</p><p>Adam states that...</p><blockquote>\"Bad tech decisions set in motion are like trains set to full steam ahead.<br><br>   At full speed, they are hard to stop and impossible to change without an expensive amount of effort and potential damage.<br><br>   Thrash around your ideas, options and decisions&nbsp;<strong>more at the start</strong> so you don't end up thrashing more at the end.\" <br><br><footer>Adam Johnstone</footer></blockquote><p>It is a little confronting, however Adam wanted the tone and feel of this website to resemble how Adam communicates. He has a no bullshit approach to tech innovation and seeks to hold nothing back in the process of telling the truth.</p><p>If you don't like that kind of opinion - then Adam is not for you and you should look elsewhere.</p><h2>Adam's Manifesto</h2><p>Adam believes and supports Eric Ries' manifesto that states that all innovation can be created through a carefully planned process (outlined in the bestselling book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Lean Startup</a>).</p><p>It's a very prescriptive approach, however in Australia the issue we face is that culturally we can be a little different to our American counterparts.</p><p>So we need a process of innovation that suited to the way \"we\" work.</p><p>Adam has decided to \"walk the walk\" and be a beacon for this tech innovation disruption that's happening all over the world.</p><p>He will be furiously presenting at Melbourne meetups, tech events and conventions across the country.</p><p>If you want to implement a process of \"constant innovation\" at your business now but your not ready to speak to someone like Adam, then we suggest that you please read <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Lean Startup</a>.</p><p>This will help you to become more familiar with the lingo and approachs that have changed entire industries, before you sit down with Adam and discuss your next move.</p><p>Otherwise click this button and...&nbsp;<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://adamjohnstone.co/pages/contact-me\" rel=\"nofollow\">&gt; Talk to Adam now</a></p>"}]},{"name":"contact-me","url":"contact-me","properties":[{"name":"meta-description","description":"The meta-description must contain the primary keyword / phrase and be no longer than 156 characters","value":"Get in contact with Adam Johnstone to discuss upcoming innovation meetups, talk about new technology or request some innovation advice."},{"name":"page-title","description":"The page title must contain the primary keyword / phrase and be no longer than 70 characters","value":"Adam Johnstone | Contact Me to Start the Conversation"}],"contents":[{"name":"adam-contact-details","value":"<p><strong>Contact Adam Johnstone.</strong><br><strong>     Ph:</strong> <a href=\"tel:+611300443648\">+61 1300 IGENIUS</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(then Press 1) </p><p><strong><a class=\"btn btn-labeled btn-info\" href=\"tel:+611300443648\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"btn-label\"><em class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-phone-alt\"></em></span>Call iGenius</a></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><img alt=\"Adam Johnstone Profile Image\" class=\"fr-fil fr-dii\" data-pin-nopin=\"true\" src=\"/images/adam-johnstone.png\" title=\"Adam Johnstone Profile Image\" width=\"100\"></p><p>Personal note from Adam - <br><em>\"Thanks for getting in touch, if you need me urgently, please email me at ajjoh5 &nbsp;at &nbsp;gmail dot com, and include \"URGENT:\" in the title.</em></p>"}]}]}
