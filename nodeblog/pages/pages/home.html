        <h2>Why Tech Innovation?</h2>
        <p>There's a lot of tech disruptors out there - Elon Musk,&nbsp;Stewart Butterfield,&nbsp;Chris Wanstrath,&nbsp;Dev Ittycheria all with a wonderful cause.</p>
        <p>Adam has worked as a IT and Tech consultant to&nbsp;some of the largest leading brands and government departments - NAB, ANZ, Telstra, Henley Homes, Dodo and noticed a common thread.</p>
        <p>Adam observed that, even at the highest levels of business&nbsp;when solving a big problem not a lot of thought goes&nbsp;into the initial product selection, or the technical framework of choice.</p>
        <p>As TedX talker <a href="http://www.tailopez.com/" target="_blank" title="Tai Lopez" class="text-link">Tai Lopez</a>&nbsp;quotes - "Make war with a multitude of counsellors and allies" - and what Adam brings to the table is a vast wealth of knowledge of open source platforms, licensed platforms and the latest technologies collected from around the globe.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Before you set out to solve your problem and choose a technology stack, have someone like Adam as one of your counsellors, before you make war with your competition.</p>
        <h2>Adam's Background&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>Adam&nbsp;started coding&nbsp;when he was 13 years old, after reading a series of Visual Basic 3.0 books cover-to-cover on a family holiday.</p>
        <p>In high school he was teaching programming classes and in University lead the collaborative projects usually as Team Lead and Lead Developer.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the industry Adam worked for large IT consultancies before niching down into specific technology platforms to get a better understanding of all of the available products and coding frameworks available to startups, small businesses and enterprise.</p>
        <p>What he realised is that in most cases, people are making decisions with less than half the picture.</p>
        <p>Usually technology stacks, platforms and products are chosen purely because the company or the coder is 'familiar' and 'comfortable' with the product.</p>
        <p>As a business owner, this means you're not looking at the full picture and making a good decision about the future.</p>
        <h2>Adam's Manifesto</h2>
        <p>Adam believes and supports Eric Ries's manifesto (outlined in the bestselling book the Lean Startup) of "Build, Measure, Learn" - but&nbsp;adds that a first step of "Select" is required&nbsp;to more carefully "select" the best idea / platform / stack before moving through the build, measure learn loop.</p>
